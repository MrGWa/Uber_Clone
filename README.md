---

## 🧱 Design Patterns Used

### 🔹 Clean Architecture
The module strictly follows Clean Architecture principles:
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business models like `Ride.cs` and enums like `RideStatus.cs`
- **Application Layer**: Contracts (interfaces) and DTOs
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data access and service logic
- **API Layer**: Exposes controller endpoints

### 🔹 Dependency Injection
Used throughout the project (see `Program.cs` in `UberClone.Api`):
```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IRideService, RideService>();
````

Enables loose coupling between `RideController` and `RideService`.

### 🔹 Service Pattern

`RideService.cs` in `UberClone.Infrastructure.Services` encapsulates all ride-related business logic.

### 🔹 Repository/DbContext Pattern

Uses `AppDbContext.cs` for EF Core in-memory storage (file: `UberClone.Infrastructure.Persistence.AppDbContext.cs`).

### 🔹 Constants Enum Pattern

Used in `RideStatus.cs` to manage ride state strings and avoid hardcoding:

```
public static class RideStatus
{
    public const string Pending = "Pending";
    public const string Accepted = "Accepted";
    public const string Completed = "Completed";
    public const string Cancelled = "Cancelled";
}
```

**Referenced In**: `RideService.cs`

---

## ⚙️ DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

**Located in**: `UberClone.Application.DTOs.Ride/`

* `RideRequestDto.cs`: Contains `PassengerId`, `PickupLocation`, `DropoffLocation`
* `RideAcceptedDto.cs`: Contains `RideId`, `DriverId`
* `RideCompletedDto.cs`: Contains `RideId`

---

## 🧪 Unit Tests

**File**: `UberClone.Tests/RideServiceTests.cs`

Test coverage includes:

* Ride request creation
* Ride acceptance by driver
* Ride completion and fare calculation
* Invalid operations (e.g., accepting/completing non-existent rides)

Tests use `EF Core InMemory` to simulate database behavior.

---

## 🧠 Notes

* Status values are enforced through `RideStatus` class to avoid hardcoding.
* Fare calculation is currently time-based: `$5.00 base fare + $1/min`.
* `AppDbContext` is used in-memory for simplified testing and development.
* Fully compatible with Admin Dashboard & Analytics module.

# 🔐 Uber Clone – User & Account Management Module

This section id the complete implementation of the **User & Account Management** module for the Uber Clone project. This backend module is developed in **C# with .NET 9**, follows **Clean Architecture principles**, and integrates seamlessly with the existing `Admin Dashboard & System Analytics` and `Ride Lifecycle Management` modules.

This module provides secure user registration, authentication, and account management capabilities. It handles user data validation, password hashing with BCrypt, and role-based access control for different user types (Passengers, Drivers, Admins).

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 🔐 1. User Registration
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/register`
- **DTO**: `RegisterUserDto`
- **Use Case**: `RegisterUserCommand`
- **Description**: Registers new users with email validation, password hashing using BCrypt, and duplicate email prevention.

### 👤 2. User Entity Management
- **Entity**: `User.cs`
- **Properties**: `Id`, `Username`, `Email`, `PasswordHash`, `Role`, `FirstName`, `LastName`
- **Role System**: Supports role-based access (Passenger, Driver, Admin)
- **Security**: Passwords are hashed using BCrypt for secure storage

### 🔍 3. User Repository Pattern
- **Interface**: `IUserRepository`
- **Implementation**: `UserRepository`
- **Methods**:
  - `GetByEmailAsync()` - Retrieve user by email
  - `GetByIdAsync()` - Retrieve user by ID
  - `AddAsync()` - Add new user
  - `IsEmailTakenAsync()` - Check email availability

---

## 🧱 Design Patterns Used

### 🔹 Clean Architecture
The module strictly follows Clean Architecture principles:
- **Domain Layer**: `User.cs` entity with business rules
- **Application Layer**: Use Cases (`RegisterUserCommand`) and interfaces
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data access (`UserRepository`) and persistence
- **API Layer**: Authentication endpoints (`AuthController`)

### 🔹 Command Pattern
`RegisterUserCommand` implements the Command pattern for user registration:
```csharp
public class RegisterUserCommand : IRegisterUserCommand
{
    public async Task ExecuteAsync(RegisterUserDto dto)
    {
        // Validation, password hashing, and user creation logic
    }
}
```

### 🔹 Repository Pattern
`UserRepository` provides abstraction over data access:
```csharp
public interface IUserRepository
{
    Task<User?> GetByEmailAsync(string email);
    Task<User?> GetByIdAsync(Guid id);
    Task AddAsync(User user);
    Task<bool> IsEmailTakenAsync(string email);
}
```

### 🔹 Dependency Injection
All services are registered in `Program.cs`:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IUserRepository, UserRepository>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IRegisterUserCommand, RegisterUserCommand>();
```

---

## 🔒 Security Features

### 🔐 Password Security
- **BCrypt Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using BCrypt with salt
- **No Plain Text Storage**: Passwords are never stored in plain text
- **Hash Verification**: Secure password verification during authentication

### 📧 Email Validation
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents registration with existing email addresses
- **Format Validation**: Ensures valid email format through DTO validation
- **Unique Constraint**: Database-level uniqueness enforcement

### 🎭 Role-Based Access Control
- **Default Role**: New users default to "Passenger" role
- **Role Assignment**: Support for Passenger, Driver, and Admin roles
- **Future Authentication**: Foundation for JWT-based authentication

---

## ⚙️ DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

**Located in**: `UberClone.Application.DTOs/`

### `RegisterUserDto.cs`
```csharp
public class RegisterUserDto
{
    public string Username { get; set; } = default!;
    public string Email { get; set; } = default!;
    public string Password { get; set; } = default!;
    public string? FirstName { get; set; }
    public string? LastName { get; set; }
}
```
